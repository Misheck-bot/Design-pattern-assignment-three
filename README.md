# Smart Home Automation System

## Overview
This Smart Home Automation System demonstrates the use of various design patterns to create a scalable, maintainable, and flexible architecture. The system allows for the management of different smart devices and automation strategies, while also providing security features.

## Design Patterns Implemented
The following design patterns have been implemented in this system:

1. Singleton
2. Factory
3. Adapter
4. Strategy
5. Observer
6. Proxy

## Running the program
To run this project, clone the repository and ensure you have Python installed. Create a `config.json` file in the root directory with the following content:

```json
{
    "devices": [
        {"type": "light", "name": "Living Room Light"},
        {"type": "thermostat", "name": "Main Thermostat"}
    ]
}


Testing and Validation
Unit Tests
Unit tests have been created to validate the functionality of each design pattern. Below is an overview of the testing process for each pattern:

1. Singleton Pattern
Test: Ensure only one instance of SmartHomeController exists.
Expected: Two calls to create instances should return the same instance.
Actual: The test confirmed that both instances are identical.
2. Factory Pattern
Test: Create devices using DeviceFactory and check their types.
Expected: The factory should return instances of the correct device type.
Actual: The test confirmed that the created devices matched the specified types.
3. Adapter Pattern
Test: Integrate a third-party device using the adapter.
Expected: The adapter should successfully connect to the third-party device.
Actual: The test confirmed that the connection was established as expected.
4. Strategy Pattern
Test: Set different automation strategies and execute them.
Expected: The correct strategy should activate the expected behavior.
Actual: The test confirmed that the correct strategy was executed.
5. Observer Pattern
Test: Notify users of security breaches.
Expected: Users should receive notifications when a breach is detected.
Actual: The test confirmed that notifications were sent correctly.
6. Proxy Pattern
Test: Control access to the door lock.
Expected: Only users with the 'admin' role should unlock the door.
Actual: The test confirmed that access control worked as intended.
Testing Process
Each pattern was tested using unit tests written in Python's unittest framework.
Tests were executed in an isolated environment to ensure accuracy.
Results were logged, and any failures were debugged to confirm expected behavior.
Reflection and Alternatives
Alternative Patterns
While the selected patterns effectively addressed the requirements, alternative patterns could have included:

Command Pattern for more complex command handling and queuing.
State Pattern for managing device states more explicitly.
I chose the implemented patterns due to their suitability for the specific functionalities required in a smart home system, such as device management, automation strategies, and user notifications.

Challenges Faced
During implementation, challenges included:

Ensuring the correct integration of various patterns without introducing tight coupling.
Managing dependencies between different components effectively.
Scaling the System
If scaling this system to manage hundreds of devices across multiple buildings:

Modular Architecture: Implement a more modular architecture where devices are managed by separate services.
Microservices: Consider using microservices to manage different functionalities independently.
Database Integration: Utilize a database to store device states and configurations persistently.
Load Balancing: Implement load balancing solutions to manage requests effectively across devices.
Conclusion
This Smart Home Automation System showcases the effective use of design patterns to create a robust, flexible, and maintainable application. Future enhancements could involve adding more devices and features, as well as improving the user interface for better interaction.
